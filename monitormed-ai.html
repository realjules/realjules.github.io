            <p><strong>Jules Udahemuka, founder of MonitorMed AI, took home the Patient Safety Technology Challenge first prize award of $1,500 in cash.</strong> MonitorMed AI quantifies the uncertainty that is inherent in predictions made by FDA-approved medical imaging AI systems by harnessing Monte Carlo dropout. Additionally, MontiorMed AI leverages these insights to “continuously monitor the AI model's performance in real-world clinical settings.” Notification of anomalies enables healthcare teams to be aware of potential issues and make more informed decisions, thereby leading to improved patient outcomes.</p>
            <p>Udahemuka said that his mother’s own experience with misdiagnoses “really highlighted the critical importance of patient safety and the need for innovative solutions. Watching her navigate the healthcare system, it just inspired me to explore ways technology could be leveraged to improve outcomes and restore that trust.” Given his AI background, he was really interested in leveraging probabilistic approaches to increase transparency and reliability in complex machine learning models. He identified a dearth of companies focused on applying such approaches to build tailored solutions within the healthcare industry that assist healthcare professionals in responsibly deploying and maintaining AI technologies. MonitorMed AI offers “a non-intrusive way to continuously monitor the reliability of medical AI models,” which ensures “these powerful tools are used safely and effectively, ultimately protecting patients like my mother.” As an example of MonitorMed AI’s clinical application, Udahemuka stated, “a radiologist reviewing a cancer screening should be able to immediately see if the model is highly confident in its findings or if there's a significant degree of ambiguity.” Udahemuka’s focus is now to turn this proof-of-concept into a robust, production-ready solution.</p>
            <p>Following the hackathon, the project was accepted into the <strong>Nucleate Activator program</strong>, where the focus has shifted to building an "Evaluation Store"—a comprehensive platform for monitoring model performance, including data quality checks, uncertainty analysis, and drift detection.</p>
